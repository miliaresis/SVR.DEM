# SVR.DEM
* **Dimension reduction of multi-dimensional elevation data for DEMs optimization & evaluation.**
  * A win python program (https://winpython.github.io/) consisting of 3 modules **dmr_mg.py** and the 2 library MODULEs **dmr_data_headers**, & **dmr_myf.py**.
  * _2-d DEM optimization method presents an alternative to DEM comparison by elevation differences modeling. In it's general version (3.d, 4.d etc., etc.) is not limited to the comparison/evaluation of only 2 DEMs but can handle 3 DEMs, 4 DEMs at the same time, etc. etc._

* **Data**
  * 2-d case study (ALOS median & mean elevations for Zagros Ranges-Iran, just stretching the method to it's limits): https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/z4nxdjdyys/4
  * 3-d case study (very small study area in Zagros Ranges-Iran):https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bd2cdf833m/8
  * 3.5-d case study (Zagros Ranges-Iran, enlarged study area): https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bswsr3gpy2/15
  * 4-d case study (Death Valley-CA-USA): https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fbd9pd6hnx/10
