# SVR.DEM
* **Dimension reduction of multi-dimensional elevation data for DEMs optimization & evaluation.**
  * A win python program (https://winpython.github.io/) consisting of 3 modules **dmr_mg.py** and the 2 library MODULEs **dmr_data_headers**, & **dmr_myf.py**.
  * _2-d DEM optimization method presents an alternative to DEM comparison by elevation differences modeling. In it's general version (3.d, 4.d etc., etc.) is not limited to the comparison/evaluation of only 2 DEMs but can handle 3 DEMs, 4 DEMs at the same time, etc. etc._
